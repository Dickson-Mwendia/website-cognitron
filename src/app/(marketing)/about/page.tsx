                <p>
                  I started Cognitron because I saw a gap that frustrated me
                  personally. The brightest children in Nairobi were consuming technology every
                  single day. They were fluent in apps, games, and social media.
                  But almost none of them had the opportunity to truly
                  understand how any of it worked, let alone build something
                  of their own.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Their schools offered basic ICT. YouTube had tutorials. But
                  none of that gave a child what they actually need: a coach
                  who sits beside them, watches how they think, adapts in real
                  time, and pushes them to build something they never thought
                  possible. That&apos;s what the best tech education in the
                  world looks like - and I believed Nairobi families deserved
                  exactly that.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So I built it. Cognitron combines coding, AI, and chess with
                  a coaching model designed for how kids actually learn:
                  small groups of four, real projects from week one, and
                  coaches who come to your home because I know what Nairobi
                  traffic does to a family&apos;s schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every child who walks through our programme leaves with
                  something tangible: an app they built, a model they trained,
                  a game they won. But more than that - they leave knowing they
                  can build things. That confidence changes everything.
