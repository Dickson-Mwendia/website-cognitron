## Learnings

<!-- Append learnings below -->

### 2026-07-21: Deployment Blocker Fixes (11 items)
- **Middleware naming (BLOCKER #1):** Next.js 16.2.1 uses `proxy.ts`/`proxy()` convention, NOT `middleware.ts`. The file was already correctly named. Renaming to middleware.ts triggers a deprecation warning. Left as `proxy.ts` with `proxy()` export — auth is active.
- **FAQ age contradiction (BLOCKER #2):** Fixed homepage FAQ to distinguish ages per track: Chess from 6, Coding from 8, AI from 10. Aligns with academy/ai page.
- **Forgot password button (BLOCKER #3):** Replaced dead `<button>` with a `<Link>` to /contact saying "Need help signing in? Contact us".
- **Demo Mode banners (BLOCKER #4):** Guarded with `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` in both login-form.tsx and signup-form.tsx. Hidden in production/staging.
- **Analytics placeholders (BLOCKER #5):** Verified — `isRealId()` guard in Analytics.tsx already prevents script injection. No change needed.
- **Okonkwo → Kamau (#6):** Replaced all instances across mock-data.ts, signup-form.tsx, add-child-client.tsx, and parent/schedule/page.tsx. First names (Amara, Fatima, Jabari) kept — they work for East Africa.
- **British English (#7):** "organize" → "organise" in testimonial, "personalized" → "personalised" in how-it-works, "Chess" → "chess" (lowercase) in chess page heading.
- **Pricing math (#8):** Fixed KES 67,600 → KES 68,000 (8,500 × 8 = 68,000). Updated USD approximation to $525.
- **Dead # links (#9):** Fixed 6 links in student dashboard: Join Lesson → /dashboard/schedule, Book a Session → /contact, Start Now → /dashboard/practice, Practice Now → /dashboard/practice, My Schedule → /dashboard/schedule, Ask Coach → /contact.
- **Founder title (#10):** About page: "Software Engineer & Founder". Homepage: "Founder" (shorter context).
- **Auth page taglines (#11):** Login: "Welcome back to Cognitron". Signup: "Create your family's Cognitron account". Replaced generic "Premium learning, reimagined".
- Build passes clean: 53/53 pages, zero TypeScript errors, zero warnings.

### 2026-04-04: Monorepo + Security Audit
- Reviewed full codebase: single Next.js app with marketing + platform in route groups. Supabase backend with 13 tables, all RLS-enabled.
- Auth stack: Supabase Auth → server-side `getUser()` (correct, not just `getSession()`), edge middleware for route protection, `requireAuth()`/`requireRole()` server-side guards, `RoleGuard` client component.
- RLS is comprehensive: role-based (student/parent/coach), parent-child linking via `is_parent_of()`, curriculum read-only for authenticated users.
- Key gaps found: no CSP headers, no email verification enforcement, no parental consent gate (critical for under-16 per Kenya DPA 2019), no rate limiting on server actions, no DELETE RLS policies, no env validation.
- Decision filed: keep monorepo, add security controls in priority order. See `.squad/decisions/inbox/rusty-security-controls.md`.

### 2026-04-04: P0 Security Controls — Headers + Env Validation
- Added comprehensive security headers in `next.config.ts`: HSTS, X-Frame-Options DENY, CSP (self-only with Supabase connect-src), nosniff, strict referrer, permissions policy. Applied to all routes via `/:path*`.
- CSP allows `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval` for script-src — required by Next.js in dev. Can tighten with nonces in production later.
- Added `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` + `zod` to package.json deps for env validation.
- Created `src/lib/env.ts`: validates Supabase URL/key in production, skips validation in dev (mock data flow). Service role key is optional server-only.
- Created `.env.example` documenting all vars with usage comments.
- Key design choice: `skipValidation: !isProduction` — dev never breaks from missing env vars, production fails fast on missing Supabase config.

### 2026-04-04: Zod Validation + Rate Limiting on Server Actions
- Replaced manual validation in `contact/actions.ts` with a Zod schema. Used `z.string().transform().pipe()` pattern to sanitize (trim + strip HTML) before validating min-length. Keeps the same user-facing error messages.
- Created `lib/rate-limit.ts` — generic in-memory rate limiter using a Map with periodic TTL cleanup. Returns `{ success, remaining, resetAt }`. Configurable window and max requests. Designed for easy swap to Upstash/Redis later.
- Applied rate limiting to the contact form action: 5 requests/min per IP, extracted from `x-forwarded-for` or `x-real-ip` headers. Graceful fallback if headers() fails.
- ZodError uses `.issues` not `.errors` — TypeScript caught it.

### 2026-04-04: Parental Consent Gate — Under-16 Age Block
- Implemented Kenya DPA 2019 §33 compliance: students under 16 cannot self-register. Age check runs client-side in the signup form for immediate UX feedback.
- Made `date_of_birth` required for student signups (was optional). Added `max` attribute on the date input to prevent future dates.
- When a student under 16 tries to sign up, the form is replaced with a friendly blocked-state card explaining the requirement, with CTAs to parent signup (`/signup?role=parent`) and login.
- Signup form now reads `?role=parent` query param to preselect the parent role — used by the age-gate CTA link.
- Created `src/app/(dashboard)/parent/add-child/page.tsx` — client component form for parents to enrol children. Matches existing design language (navy/gold, rounded-2xl, lucide icons).
- Created `src/app/(dashboard)/parent/add-child/actions.ts` — server action using Supabase Admin API (service role key) to create child auth user, profile, and `parent_student_links` entry. Includes Zod validation, rate limiting, role verification, and cleanup on failure.
- Updated parent dashboard with an "Add Child" button linking to `/parent/add-child`.
- Supabase typed client `.select()` with `.single()` can produce `never` types when TypeScript narrows role unions — fixed with explicit `as Profile | null` cast after the query.
- Generated passwords use `crypto.randomBytes(24).toString('base64url')` + complexity suffix — children use parent-managed access or password reset flow.

### 2026-04-04: Contact Form → Supabase Persistence
- Created migration `supabase/migrations/20250403000000_contact_submissions.sql`: new `contact_submissions` table with status workflow (`new` → `contacted` → `enrolled` → `closed`), RLS enabled.
- RLS policies: anon/authenticated can INSERT (server action uses anon key), only coaches can SELECT (via `profiles.role = 'coach'` check). No UPDATE/DELETE policies — admin-only via service role.
- Updated `src/app/contact/actions.ts` to insert into `contact_submissions` via Supabase server client after Zod validation passes. Maps camelCase form fields to snake_case DB columns. Empty optional fields stored as NULL.
- Dev-mode fallback preserved: if `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are missing, submissions log to console as before. No breakage for local dev without Supabase.
- All existing validation (Zod schema with HTML stripping), rate limiting (5/min per IP), and user-facing messages preserved exactly.

### 2026-04-04: Admin Approval Gate — Users Must Be Approved Before Dashboard Access
- **Database migration** (`20250716000000_approval_gate.sql`): Adds `approved`, `approved_at`, `approved_by` columns to `profiles`. Backfills all existing users as approved. Auto-approve trigger for admin role on INSERT.
- **Type updates**: Added 3 new fields to `profiles` Row/Insert/Update in `database.ts`. Added `approved: boolean` to `DashboardUser` in `types/index.ts`.
- **Auth library** (`auth.ts`): `getCurrentUser()` now returns `approved` field. `requireAuth()` redirects unapproved users to `/pending-approval`. `requireRole()` has belt-and-suspenders approval check.
- **Middleware** (`middleware.ts`): Consolidated approval + role queries into a single `profiles` SELECT (was 2 queries, now 1). `/pending-approval` added to protected paths. Unapproved → `/pending-approval` redirect. Approved on pending page → `/dashboard` redirect. No infinite loops.
- **Pending approval page** (`src/app/pending-approval/page.tsx`): Standalone server component outside both route groups — uses root layout only (no Navbar/Footer/DashboardLayout). Shows clock icon, user's first name, WhatsApp contact, and sign-out button.
- **Admin approvals page** (`src/app/(dashboard)/admin/approvals/page.tsx`): Client component with search, approve/reject buttons, flash messages, empty state. Server action stubs in `actions.ts`. Added `Approvals` nav item with `UserCheck` icon to DashboardLayout admin nav.
- **Mock data**: All 4 mock users get `approved: true`. Added `mockPendingUsers` array (4 sample users) for admin approvals page.
- **Signup flow**: Both dev-mode and Supabase paths in `signup-form.tsx` now redirect to `/pending-approval` instead of `/dashboard`.
- Dev mode (no Supabase) unaffected: mock users are pre-approved, middleware skips entirely.

### 2026-04-04: Performance Quick Wins — Batch 2
- **Analytics lazy-loading:** Changed `Analytics.tsx` from `strategy="afterInteractive"` to `strategy="lazyOnload"` for both GA4 and Meta Pixel scripts. Analytics scripts no longer block page rendering at all — they load only after the page is fully idle.
- **Placeholder ID guard:** Added `isRealId()` check that skips injecting analytics scripts entirely when IDs contain `XXXXXXXXXX`. No network requests, no DOM pollution in dev. The component returns `null` when both IDs are placeholders.
- **Event tracking gated:** `gtagPageView` and `fbqTrack` calls in the `useEffect` are now conditional on real IDs being present. `analytics-utils.ts` left untouched — those helpers already guard on `window.gtag`/`window.fbq` existence.
- **next/image for avatars:** Converted `<img>` tags in `DashboardLayout.tsx` (32×32 user avatar) and `StudentCard.tsx` (44×44 student avatar) to `next/image` `<Image>` with explicit `width`/`height`. Enables automatic WebP/AVIF conversion, lazy loading, and blur-up.
- **Supabase image domain:** Added `images.remotePatterns` to `next.config.ts` for `*.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/**`. Required for `next/image` to optimise Supabase-hosted avatars/uploads.
- **No `<img>` on public pages:** Scanned all `src/` — the homepage and other marketing pages use Lucide icons, emojis, and styled divs exclusively. No raster `<img>` tags found outside of the dashboard avatar components and the Meta Pixel noscript tracking pixel (which must stay as `<img>`).

### 2026-04-04: MDX Blog System
- Built full MDX blog infrastructure: `content/blog/` → `src/lib/blog.ts` → `src/app/blog/page.tsx` + `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`.
- Dependencies added to `package.json`: `gray-matter` (frontmatter), `next-mdx-remote` (server-side MDX rendering), `reading-time` (read time calc), `@tailwindcss/typography` (devDep for prose classes).
- `src/lib/blog.ts` reads `.mdx` files from `content/blog/` at build time using `fs`/`path`/`process.cwd()`. Exports `getAllPosts()` (sorted newest-first), `getPostBySlug()`, and `PostMeta`/`Post` types.
- Created 5 substantive seed posts (400–600 words each): coding for Kenyan kids, AI literacy, chess & academics, screen time reframe, family online safety. All written from Cognitron's perspective with CTAs.
- Updated blog index to import `getAllPosts()` dynamically instead of hardcoded array. Same JSX/styling, just swapped the data source.
- Created `[slug]/page.tsx`: server component using `MDXRemote` from `next-mdx-remote/rsc` (zero client JS). Custom `mdxComponents` map styles h2/h3/p/ul/ol/blockquote/a/code to match site design (navy headings, gold accents). `generateStaticParams()` + `generateMetadata()` for full static pre-rendering + SEO.
- Design decision: avoided `@next/mdx` in favour of `next-mdx-remote/rsc` — simpler setup, no config changes, works as pure server components with `force-static`.
- All 5 MDX filenames match the slugs already used in the old hardcoded blog index. No broken links.

### 2026-04-04: Student/Parent/Coach Dashboards + Supabase Auth
- **35 files created/modified** across 4 phases.
- **Auth:** Installed `@supabase/supabase-js` + `@supabase/ssr`. Created client/server/middleware helpers in `src/lib/supabase/`. Built `/login` + `/signup` pages with demo mode fallback. Route protection via Next.js 16 proxy.
- **Database:** Migration `20250101000000_initial_schema.sql` — 13 tables, RLS policies for 3 roles (student/parent/coach), helper functions, auto-profile trigger, track seed data.
- **Dashboard pages:** `/dashboard` (student home), `/dashboard/[track]` (track detail), `/dashboard/achievements` (badges/XP/streaks), `/parent` (children overview), `/coach` (student roster).
- **10 reusable components:** ProgressRing, XPBar, StreakCounter, AchievementBadge, SessionCard, TrackCard, LevelMap, StudentCard, DashboardLayout, RoleGuard.
- Coral + teal added to theme. Build passes clean.

### 2026-04-04: Admin Dashboard — 7 Pages + 9 Components
- Built full admin dashboard using Danny's spec.
- **7 pages:** `/admin` (KPI cockpit with sparklines + alerts), `/admin/students` (searchable DataTable + detail drawer + CSV export), `/admin/coaches` (roster + utilization + create coach modal), `/admin/revenue` (MRR/ARR + revenue by track + trends), `/admin/curriculum` (interactive tree browser + CRUD), `/admin/sessions` (session management), `/admin/settings` (pricing, notifications, announcements, config).
- **9 admin components:** KPICard, DataTable, SparklineChart, AlertFeed, MetricTrend, ExportButton, CurriculumTree, CreateCoachModal, StudentDetailDrawer.
- **DB migration:** 10 new tables (audit_log, invoices, payments, alerts, etc.) with full RLS + admin SQL functions.
- Added `admin` role to RoleGuard, DashboardLayout nav, middleware protection, TypeScript types. Build passes clean.

### 2026-04-04: Dashboard UX Plan — Post-Linus Review
- Reviewed Linus's full UX review (14 files changed, score 5.7→7.6). His direct fixes covered layout theme conflicts, nav routes, active states, micro-interactions, a11y, and empty states.
- Audited all 12 missing nav pages: 4 student, 5 parent, 3 coach. None exist yet — every nav click beyond the home page of each role is a dead link.
- Biggest structural debt: root `layout.tsx` renders Navbar/Footer/WhatsApp for ALL routes. Dashboard uses `fixed inset-0 z-50` overlay to hide them. Proper fix is `(marketing)` route group separation — flagged as P0-1.
- Created prioritized plan with 4 P0 items (route groups, stub pages, parent empty state, auth polish), 8 P1 items, 12 P2 items. P0+P1 estimated at 6–8 dev days.
- Age-tier theming (3 tiers: 5–8, 9–12, 13–17) is the largest item (XL) and fully blocked on Linus providing design tokens. Deferred to P2.
- Performance constraint: must stay under 500KB initial load. All new libraries (e.g., canvas-confetti for XP celebrations) must be lazy-loaded.
- Kenya DPA implications noted: profile page must not expose DOB, coach notes are PII needing RLS, social sharing must not include student names without parent consent.
- Plan written to `.squad/decisions/inbox/rusty-dashboard-ux-plan.md`.

### 2026-04-04: Dashboard UX Improvements (P0-3, P0-4, P1-7, P1-8)
- **P0-3 Parent Empty State:** Added empty-state cards for children (warm onboarding with "Add Your First Child" CTA), upcoming sessions (calendar icon + "Book a Session" CTA), and coach notes (informational message). Uses dashed-border pattern with track-colored accents. Existing populated states wrapped in else branches — zero visual change for parents with data.
- **P0-4 Login/Signup Visual Polish:** Replaced flat `bg-navy` on login and signup pages with `bg-gradient-to-br from-navy via-navy-dark to-navy`. Added two decorative glow divs (gold top-right, teal bottom-left) with `blur-3xl` and `pointer-events-none`. Inner content elevated with `relative z-10`.
- **P1-7 Remember Me Checkbox:** Added `rememberMe` state (default `true`) to login form. Checkbox placed between password field and submit button, inline with "Forgot password?" link. UX signal only — Supabase sessions are already persistent.
- **P1-8 Student Profile Page:** Created `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/profile/page.tsx` as a server component. Includes: avatar with initials, name/role/age badge header, 4 quick-stat cards (XP, streak, achievements, level), enrolled tracks with progress bars, read-only account settings section, and action buttons (back to dashboard, parent dashboard, sign out). Uses Lucide icons and consistent dashboard design language.
### 2026-04-04: P0-1 Route Group Separation (Fix Double Navigation)
- Created `(marketing)` route group under `src/app/`. Moved all 12 marketing/auth page directories (`about/`, `academy/`, `blog/`, `contact/`, `how-it-works/`, `pricing/`, `privacy/`, `protect/`, `terms/`, `login/`, `signup/`) and `page.tsx` (home) into it.
- Created `src/app/(marketing)/layout.tsx` — renders `<Analytics>`, `<Navbar>`, `<main>`, `<Footer>`, `<WhatsAppButton>`. No `<html>`/`<body>` tags (those stay in root).
- Simplified root `layout.tsx` — removed Navbar, Footer, WhatsAppButton, Analytics imports and JSX. Now only handles fonts, metadata, and the bare `<html>`/`<body>` wrapper.
- Fixed `DashboardLayout.tsx` — changed outer container from `fixed inset-0 z-50` to `flex h-screen`. Dashboard no longer needs to "cover" marketing chrome because it's in a separate route group.
- Deleted empty `(auth)/` route group.
- One import fix required: `ContactForm.tsx` referenced `@/app/contact/actions` — updated to `@/app/(marketing)/contact/actions`. Route groups are filesystem-visible in import paths even though they don't affect URLs.
- Build passes clean. All 40 routes render at their original URL paths — route groups are transparent to users.

### 2026-04-04: Coaches Section on About Page
- Added "Our Coaches" section to About page between Founder Story and Values.
- Coaches data defined as a typed array above the component return. Currently one coach (Dickson Mwendia, Microsoft). Array is extensible — just add objects.
- Used `flex justify-center` instead of grid so a single card centers naturally without looking sparse in a 3-column grid.
- Coach card matches founder avatar style (navy circle, gold initials). Includes LinkedIn link via inline SVG (lucide-react has no LinkedIn icon).
- Includes "Why practising engineers?" navy callout box below the cards.
- Changed Values section background from `bg-off-white` to `bg-white` to maintain alternating background pattern: navy → white → off-white → white → navy.

### 2026-04-04: P0-2 — 11 "Coming Soon" Stub Pages for Missing Nav Items
- Created shared `ComingSoon` component at `src/components/dashboard/ComingSoon.tsx` — reusable placeholder with icon, title, description, "Coming soon" badge, and back-link button. Uses Lucide icons and matches dashboard design language (navy/gold palette).
- Created 11 stub pages (profile already existed): 3 student (`tracks`, `practice`, `schedule`), 5 parent (`children`, `schedule`, `messages`, `billing`, `reports`), 3 coach (`sessions`, `notes`, `schedule`).
- Each page is an async server component with `metadata` export and proper auth guard: student pages use `requireAuth()`, parent pages use `requireRole(['parent'])`, coach pages use `requireRole(['coach'])`.
- Exported `ComingSoon` from `src/components/dashboard/index.ts` barrel.
- Zero TypeScript errors. Every sidebar nav link in DashboardLayout now resolves to a real page.

### 2026-04-04: P1-4, P1-5, P1-6 — Last P1 Dashboard Features
- **P1-6 Payment Status Indicator:** Added per-child payment status badges on parent dashboard cards. Uses a `paymentStatus` lookup map (child ID → `'paid' | 'due' | 'overdue'`). Rendered as colored pill badges below the stats grid: emerald for paid, amber for due, red for overdue. Each with a contextual icon (✓, 🕐, ⚠).
- **P1-5 Coach Session Notes Inline Editing:** Created `CoachNoteEditor.tsx` client component with full inline edit flow — click Edit → textarea appears → Save/Cancel buttons. Optimistic UI updates with "Saving…" indicator. Added `mockCoachEditableNotes` (4 notes) to mock-data.ts. Component added below Upcoming Sessions on coach dashboard.
- **P1-4 Parent Progress Comparison Chart:** Created `ProgressComparison.tsx` — pure CSS/Tailwind horizontal bar chart. Shows XP (gold), Streak (coral), Level (teal) side-by-side for each child. Proportional widths relative to max value. Only renders when 2+ children exist. Added below children cards on parent dashboard.
- Both new components exported from `src/components/dashboard/index.ts` barrel. No npm packages added. Build passes clean.

### 2025-07-18: Dashboard Security & Auth Hardening — 6 Issues Fixed
- **Admin approval actions wired:** Replaced `console.log` stubs in `actions.ts` with real Supabase service-role calls. `approveUser()` updates `profiles.approved/approved_at/approved_by`; `rejectUser()` deletes from `auth.users` (cascades). Both verify caller is admin via `getAdminProfile()` helper. Dev mode (no Supabase) returns mock success with console warning.
- **Server-side auth on approvals page:** Split `page.tsx` into server wrapper (`requireRole(['admin'])`) + `approvals-client.tsx`. Pattern matches all other admin pages.
- **Server-side auth on parent add-child page:** Same split — `requireRole(['parent'])` in server wrapper, form in `add-child-client.tsx`.
- **RLS self-approval prevention:** New migration `20250717000000_restrict_profile_update.sql` replaces the permissive `profiles_update` policy with one that uses `WITH CHECK` to freeze `role`, `approved`, `approved_at`, `approved_by` on self-updates. Subquery pattern `(SELECT p.col FROM profiles p WHERE p.id = profiles.id)` compares NEW vs OLD. `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` used for nullable columns (`approved_at`, `approved_by`). Admin updates unaffected (goes through `admin_all_profiles` policy).
- **Student role enforced on /dashboard/* pages:** Changed all 7 student pages from `requireAuth()` to `requireRole(['student'])`. This prevents coaches/parents/admins from accidentally landing on student-only pages.
- **Dev mock user respects route:** `requireAuth()` now reads request path via `headers()` to return role-appropriate mock user. Checks `x-invoke-path`, `x-pathname`, `x-next-url`, and `referer` header. `requireRole()` also overrides mock role to match `allowedRoles[0]` in dev when path detection doesn't match.
- Key auth pattern: `createServiceClient` from `@supabase/supabase-js` (not `@supabase/ssr`) for admin operations that bypass RLS. The `createClient` from `@/lib/supabase/server` uses the anon key and respects RLS — used for verifying the caller's identity. Two-client pattern: anon for auth check, service-role for privileged writes.
- Build: 53 pages, zero errors.

### 2026-04-04: View Student Dashboard + Editable Progress Report
- **4 new routes:** `/admin/students/[id]`, `/admin/students/[id]/report`, `/coach/students/[id]`, `/coach/students/[id]/report`. All server components with `requireRole` guards.
- **3 new shared components:** `StudentDashboardView` (reusable student dashboard, accepts data as props), `ViewingAsBanner` (gold-accent banner with back link + "Generate Progress Report" CTA), `ProgressReportEditor` (full editable progress report — client component with inline editing for all sections).
- **StudentDashboardView** extracted from the student dashboard page (`/dashboard/page.tsx`). Accepts tracks, achievements, activity, streak data as props. `viewOnly` prop adjusts wording ("Your Next Move" → "Next Scheduled Session"). Both admin and coach student pages use it.
- **ProgressReportEditor** is a client component with 10 editable sections: period, overall assessment, per-track progress (skills checklist, strengths/improvements textareas, project list), attendance (number inputs + % calc), engagement (5-star rating), achievements (add/remove), goals, coach notes (private with coral accent), recommendations. "Save Draft" and "Send to Parent" show toast stubs. "Print / PDF" uses `window.print()`.
- **Print CSS** added to `globals.css`: `@media print` block hides nav/aside, removes shadows/borders from inputs, clean page margins. Report elements use `print:hidden` utility for action buttons.
- **Mock data:** Added `ProgressReportData` interface and `mockProgressReport` to mock-data.ts with realistic Amara Okonkwo data across all 3 tracks.
- **Wiring:** `StudentDetailDrawer` "View Full Dashboard" button now navigates to `/admin/students/[id]` via `useRouter`. Coach `StudentRosterClient` cards are now `<Link>` elements pointing to `/coach/students/[id]`.
- Build: 57 routes, zero errors. 4 new dynamic routes confirmed.

### 2026-04-04: Chess Playground Spec — Technical Review
- Reviewed Livingston's 1,193-line chess playground specification at `/dashboard/practice`.
- **3 blockers found:** (1) RLS policies reference non-existent `student_coaches` table — our schema uses `coach_assignments`. Also `student_id = auth.uid()` is wrong — should be `student_id IN (SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE user_id = auth.uid())`. (2) Glicko-2 rating calc MUST be server-side via Server Actions, not client-side (manipulation risk). (3) CSP headers need `wasm-unsafe-eval` for Stockfish WASM.
- **Key recommendations:** Use react-chessboard v5.10.0 (not 4.x — v5 has React 19 peer dep), stockfish v18 (not v16), serve WASM from `/public/stockfish/` to avoid Turbopack bundler issues, map 4 chess tiers to 3 existing DB age_tiers using rating as discriminator.
- **Proposed 4-phase plan:** Phase 1 = puzzles only (3-4 sessions, no engine needed), Phase 2 = engine play (3-4 sessions), Phase 3 = game review (2-3 sessions), Phase 4 = polish + coach/parent (2-3 sessions). Total MVP: 10-14 sessions.
- Confirmed no table naming conflicts with existing 24 tables. FK references to `profiles(id)` match existing pattern.
- Review written to `.squad/decisions/inbox/rusty-chess-review.md`.
